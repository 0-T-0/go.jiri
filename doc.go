Command jiri is a multi-purpose tool for multi-repo development.

Usage:
   jiri [flags] <command>

The jiri commands are:
   cl           Manage project changelists
   contributors List project contributors
   project      Manage the jiri projects
   rebuild      Rebuild the jiri command line tool
   snapshot     Manage project snapshots
   update       Update all jiri tools and projects
   version      Print version
   help         Display help for commands or topics

The jiri flags are:
 -color=true
   Use color to format output.
 -n=false
   Show what commands will run but do not execute them.
 -v=false
   Print verbose output.

The global flags are:
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.

Jiri cl - Manage project changelists

Manage project changelists.

Usage:
   jiri cl <command>

The jiri cl commands are:
   cleanup     Clean up changelists that have been merged
   mail        Mail a changelist for review
   new         Create a new local branch for a changelist
   sync        Bring a changelist up to date

Jiri cl cleanup - Clean up changelists that have been merged

Command "cleanup" checks that the given branches have been merged into the
corresponding remote branch. If a branch differs from the corresponding remote
branch, the command reports the difference and stops. Otherwise, it deletes the
given branches.

Usage:
   jiri cl cleanup [flags] <branches>

<branches> is a list of branches to cleanup.

The jiri cl cleanup flags are:
 -f=false
   Ignore unmerged changes.
 -remote-branch=master
   Name of the remote branch the CL pertains to.

Jiri cl mail - Mail a changelist for review

Command "mail" squashes all commits of a local branch into a single "changelist"
and mails this changelist to Gerrit as a single commit. First time the command
is invoked, it generates a Change-Id for the changelist, which is appended to
the commit message. Consecutive invocations of the command use the same
Change-Id by default, informing Gerrit that the incomming commit is an update of
an existing changelist.

Usage:
   jiri cl mail [flags]

The jiri cl mail flags are:
 -autosubmit=false
   Automatically submit the changelist when feasiable.
 -cc=
   Comma-seperated list of emails or LDAPs to cc.
 -check-uncommitted=true
   Check that no uncommitted changes exist.
 -d=false
   Send a draft changelist.
 -edit=true
   Open an editor to edit the CL description.
 -host=
   Gerrit host to use.  Defaults to gerrit host specified in manifest.
 -m=
   CL description.
 -presubmit=all
   The type of presubmit tests to run. Valid values: none,all.
 -r=
   Comma-seperated list of emails or LDAPs to request review.
 -remote-branch=master
   Name of the remote branch the CL pertains to.
 -set-topic=true
   Set Gerrit CL topic.
 -topic=
   CL topic, defaults to <username>-<branchname>.

Jiri cl new - Create a new local branch for a changelist

Command "new" creates a new local branch for a changelist. In particular, it
forks a new branch with the given name from the current branch and records the
relationship between the current branch and the new branch in the .jiri metadata
directory. The information recorded in the .jiri metadata directory tracks
dependencies between CLs and is used by the "jiri cl sync" and "jiri cl mail"
commands.

Usage:
   jiri cl new <name>

<name> is the changelist name.

Jiri cl sync - Bring a changelist up to date

Command "sync" brings the CL identified by the current branch up to date with
the branch tracking the remote branch this CL pertains to. To do that, the
command uses the information recorded in the .jiri metadata directory to
identify the sequence of dependent CLs leading to the current branch. The
command then iterates over this sequence bringing each of the CLs up to date
with its ancestor. The end result of this process is that all CLs in the
sequence are up to date with the branch that tracks the remote branch this CL
pertains to.

NOTE: It is possible that the command cannot automatically merge changes in an
ancestor into its dependent. When that occurs, the command is aborted and prints
instructions that need to be followed before the command can be retried.

Usage:
   jiri cl sync [flags]

The jiri cl sync flags are:
 -remote-branch=master
   Name of the remote branch the CL pertains to.

Jiri contributors - List project contributors

Lists project contributors. Projects to consider can be specified as an
argument. If no projects are specified, all projects in the current manifest are
considered by default.

Usage:
   jiri contributors [flags] <projects>

<projects> is a list of projects to consider.

The jiri contributors flags are:
 -aliases=
   Path to the aliases file.
 -n=false
   Show number of contributions.

Jiri project - Manage the jiri projects

Manage the jiri projects.

Usage:
   jiri project <command>

The jiri project commands are:
   clean        Restore jiri projects to their pristine state
   list         List existing jiri projects and branches
   shell-prompt Print a succinct status of projects suitable for shell prompts
   poll         Poll existing jiri projects

Jiri project clean - Restore jiri projects to their pristine state

Restore jiri projects back to their master branches and get rid of all the local
branches and changes.

Usage:
   jiri project clean [flags] <project ...>

<project ...> is a list of projects to clean up.

The jiri project clean flags are:
 -branches=false
   Delete all non-master branches.

Jiri project list - List existing jiri projects and branches

Inspect the local filesystem and list the existing projects and branches.

Usage:
   jiri project list [flags]

The jiri project list flags are:
 -branches=false
   Show project branches.
 -nopristine=false
   If true, omit pristine projects, i.e. projects with a clean master branch and
   no other branches.

Jiri project shell-prompt - Print a succinct status of projects suitable for shell prompts

Reports current branches of jiri projects (repositories) as well as an
indication of each project's status:
  *  indicates that a repository contains uncommitted changes
  %  indicates that a repository contains untracked files

Usage:
   jiri project shell-prompt [flags]

The jiri project shell-prompt flags are:
 -check-dirty=true
   If false, don't check for uncommitted changes or untracked files. Setting
   this option to false is dangerous: dirty master branches will not appear in
   the output.
 -show-name=false
   Show the name of the current repo.

Jiri project poll - Poll existing jiri projects

Poll jiri projects that can affect the outcome of the given tests and report
whether any new changes in these projects exist. If no tests are specified, all
projects are polled by default.

Usage:
   jiri project poll [flags] <test ...>

<test ...> is a list of tests that determine what projects to poll.

The jiri project poll flags are:
 -manifest=
   Name of the project manifest.

Jiri rebuild - Rebuild the jiri command line tool

Rebuild the jiri command line tool.

Usage:
   jiri rebuild

Jiri snapshot - Manage project snapshots

The "jiri snapshot" command can be used to manage project snapshots. In
particular, it can be used to create new snapshots and to list existing
snapshots.

The command-line flag "-remote" determines whether the command pertains to
"local" snapshots that are only stored locally or "remote" snapshots the are
revisioned in the manifest repository.

Usage:
   jiri snapshot [flags] <command>

The jiri snapshot commands are:
   create      Create a new project snapshot
   list        List existing project snapshots

The jiri snapshot flags are:
 -remote=false
   Manage remote snapshots.

Jiri snapshot create - Create a new project snapshot

The "jiri snapshot create <label>" command captures the current project state in
a manifest and, depending on the value of the -remote flag, the command either
stores the manifest in the local $JIRI_ROOT/.snapshots directory, or in the
manifest repository, pushing the change to the remote repository and thus making
it available globally.

Internally, snapshots are organized as follows:

 <snapshot-dir>/
   labels/
     <label1>/
       <label1-snapshot1>
       <label1-snapshot2>
       ...
     <label2>/
       <label2-snapshot1>
       <label2-snapshot2>
       ...
     <label3>/
     ...
   <label1> # a symlink to the latest <label1-snapshot*>
   <label2> # a symlink to the latest <label2-snapshot*>
   ...

NOTE: Unlike the jiri tool commands, the above internal organization is not an
API. It is an implementation and can change without notice.

Usage:
   jiri snapshot create [flags] <label>

<label> is the snapshot label.

The jiri snapshot create flags are:
 -time-format=2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00
   Time format for snapshot file name.

Jiri snapshot list - List existing project snapshots

The "snapshot list" command lists existing snapshots of the labels specified as
command-line arguments. If no arguments are provided, the command lists
snapshots for all known labels.

Usage:
   jiri snapshot list <label ...>

<label ...> is a list of snapshot labels.

Jiri update - Update all jiri tools and projects

Updates all jiri projects, builds the latest version of jiri tools, and installs
the resulting binaries into $JIRI_ROOT/devtools/bin. The sequence in which the
individual updates happen guarantees that we end up with a consistent set of
tools and source code.

The set of project and tools to update is describe by a manifest. Jiri manifests
are revisioned and stored in a "manifest" repository, that is available locally
in $JIRI_ROOT/.manifest. The manifest uses the following XML schema:

 <manifest>
   <imports>
     <import name="default"/>
     ...
   </imports>
   <projects>
     <project name="release.go.jiri"
              path="release/go/src/v.io/jiri"
              protocol="git"
              name="https://vanadium.googlesource.com/release.go.jiri"
              revision="HEAD"/>
     ...
   </projects>
   <tools>
     <tool name="jiri" package="v.io/jiri"/>
     ...
   </tools>
 </manifest>

The <import> element can be used to share settings across multiple manifests.
Import names are interpreted relative to the $JIRI_ROOT/.manifest/v2 directory.
Import cycles are not allowed and if a project or a tool is specified multiple
times, the last specification takes effect. In particular, the elements <project
name="foo" exclude="true"/> and <tool name="bar" exclude="true"/> can be used to
exclude previously included projects and tools.

The tool identifies which manifest to use using the following algorithm. If the
$JIRI_ROOT/.local_manifest file exists, then it is used. Otherwise, the
$JIRI_ROOT/.manifest/v2/<manifest>.xml file is used, which <manifest> is the
value of the -manifest command-line flag, which defaults to "default".

NOTE: Unlike the jiri tool commands, the above manifest file format is not an
API. It is an implementation and can change without notice.

Usage:
   jiri update [flags]

The jiri update flags are:
 -attempts=1
   Number of attempts before failing.
 -gc=false
   Garbage collect obsolete repositories.
 -manifest=
   Name of the project manifest.

Jiri version - Print version

Print version of the jiri tool.

Usage:
   jiri version

Jiri help - Display help for commands or topics

Help with no args displays the usage of the parent command.

Help with args displays the usage of the specified sub-command or help topic.

"help ..." recursively displays help for all commands and topics.

Usage:
   jiri help [flags] [command/topic ...]

[command/topic ...] optionally identifies a specific sub-command or help topic.

The jiri help flags are:
 -style=compact
   The formatting style for help output:
      compact - Good for compact cmdline output.
      full    - Good for cmdline output, shows all global flags.
      godoc   - Good for godoc processing.
   Override the default by setting the CMDLINE_STYLE environment variable.
 -width=<terminal width>
   Format output to this target width in runes, or unlimited if width < 0.
   Defaults to the terminal width if available.  Override the default by setting
   the CMDLINE_WIDTH environment variable.
